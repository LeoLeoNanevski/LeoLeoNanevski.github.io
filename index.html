                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>After 12+ years on the front lines of logistics, I'm pivoting to a career in IT. I've been the end-user, and now I'm training to be the builder.</p>
                <p>I'm not a typical junior. I'm a "bridge" professional who speaks both fluent Operations and emerging Code. This profile is my CV, built to "show, not tell."</p>
