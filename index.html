                <h3>Professional Summary (The "Why")</h3>
                <p>Hello. I'm Leo. For over 12 years, I was the person on the ground in high-pressure logistics hubs (like TAV Airports and DHL Express). I was the end-user for the exact kind of software IT companies build: I managed 24/7 incidents, supported software transitions, and saw every "bug" from the operational side.</p>
                <p>I decided to stop being just the user and learn to be the builder. I've spent the last two years in a deliberate career pivot, training intensively in the Microsoft ecosystem (MS SQL, C#, and Azure).</p>
                <p class="highlight">I'm not a typical junior. I'm the "bridge" who speaks both languages: I can talk to a customs agent about a process bottleneck and then turn around and discuss the database schema with the development team.</p>
